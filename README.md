# To run the app locally

I used yarn package manager, so be sure that you are not using npm to avoid errors.

If you want to do a build, use the command: yarn run build. The build will be generated automatically on "dist" folder.

To run the app locally, use the command: yarn dev. This is going to create a port in the localhost.
